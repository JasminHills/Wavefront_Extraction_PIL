# Wavefront_Extraction_PIL
Trained Unet model to reconstruct wavefront abberations from focal spot images for a known geometry. Propagation dynamics were incorporated in the loss function through the introduction of a PyTorch laser propagation module (based on the lasy angular spectrum propagator).
